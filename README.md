# Nonogram-project-FMI
Final project for my Introduction to programming course
Here i've put on the .cpp file and the puzzle flies used to load the puzzles. 
*If you play for the first time please keep in mind that you have to create your own account first
*If the .cpp has to be loaded on a console app mind the location of the puzzles - their directory is listed one folder ABOVE the source file
